I believe [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) in these days. It had become one of the have-to master tools for programmers. [*Pro Git*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by [Scott Chacon](http://scottchacon.com/about.html) and [Ben Straub](https://ben.straub.cc/) is a book introduced by [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/site). So we may refer to this book as the Git Bible.
