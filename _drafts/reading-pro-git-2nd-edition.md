I believe [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) in these days. It had become one of the have-to master tools for programmers. [*Pro Git*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by [Scott Chacon](http://scottchacon.com/about.html) and [Ben Straub](https://ben.straub.cc/) is a book introduced by [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/site). So we may refer to this book as the Git Bible.

## The Structure of This Book

- **Chapter 1. Getting Started**: What Git is and how it's different from any centralized version control systems. Also, how to install and set up Git.
- **Chapter 2. Git Basics**: Basic local Git operations.
- **Chapter 3. Git Branching**: This chapter introduces the [**killer feature**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_feature) of Git -- the branching model. How to crate a new branch, how to switch and merge between branches, how to push a branch to a shared server, and how to rebase branches.  
- **Chapter 4. Git on the Server**: How to build a server hosting a Git repository for collaboration.
