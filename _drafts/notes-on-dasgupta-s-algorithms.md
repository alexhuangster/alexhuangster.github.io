## Chapter 0. Prologue

### 0.2. Enter Fibonacci

> No other sequence of numbers has been studied as extensively, or applied to more fields: biology, demography, art, architecture, music, to name just a few. And, together with the powers of 2, it is computer scienceâ€™s favorite sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as

$$
F_n = 
\begin{cases}
0, & n = 0 \\
1, & n = 1 \\
F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, & n > 1
\end{cases}
$$

Below is a try to find the growing pattern of $F_n$.

Since $F_{n-1} \geq F_{n-2}$, we have $2F_{n-2} \leq F_{n} \leq 2F_{n-1}$. First, pay attention to the right side inequality, it is easy to get that $F_{n} \leq 2^{n-2}F_{2} = 2^{n-2} < 2^{n}$. Next, we consider that left side inequality, there are two cases:

1. If $n$ is odd, we get that 
   
   $$
   \begin{align}
   F_{n} &\geq 2F_{n-2} \geq 2^{2}F_{n-2\times2} \geq 2^{3}F_{n-2\times3} \geq \cdots \\
         &\geq 2^{(n-3)/2}F_{3} \\
         &= 2^{(n-3)/2}\times2 \\
         &= 2^{0.5n-0.5}
   \end{align}
   $$

2. If $n$ is even, the inference is similar to the above, and finally we get that
   
   $$
   F_{n} \geq 2^{(n-2)/2}F_{2} = 2^{0.5n-1}
   $$

Can we cut off the constants in the exponents so that let these inequalities look more simple and beautiful? Yes, we can. The answer is to adjust the range of $n$, since we are only interested in taking $n$ larger values.

1. Considering the odd case.

    $$
    F_{n} \geq 2^{(n-5)/2}F_{5} = 2^{0.5n-2.5}\times5 \approx 2^{0.5n} \times 0.88...
    $$

    Oops!

    $$
    F_{n} \geq 2^{(n-7)/2}F_{7} = 2^{0.5n-3.5}\times13 \approx 2^{0.5n} \times 1.14... > 2^{0.5n}
    $$
    
    OK! We know that all odd integers $n \geq 7$, we have $F_{n} \geq 2^{0.5n}$.

2. Considering the even case.

    $$
    F_{n} \geq 2^{(n-4)/2}F_{4} = 2^{0.5n-2}\times3 = 2^{0.5n} \times 0.75
    $$

    Oops!

    $$
    F_{n} \geq 2^{(n-6)/2}F_{6} = 2^{0.5n-3}\times8 = 2^{0.5n}
    $$

    OK! We know that all even integers $n \geq 6$, we have $F_{n} \geq 2^{0.5n}$.

In summary, for all integers $n \geq 6$, we have $F_{n} \geq 2^{0.5n}$. $\blacksquare$

The next question is: Can we find a constant $c$ so that $F_n = \Theta(2^{cn})$? 

We are very confident that the constant is existed, since we have proved that for all $n \geq 6$, $2^{0.5n} \leq F_{n} \leq 2^n$ is held.

We suppose it is existed, then $F_n \leq 2^{cn}$ is held for large $n$. Mathematical induction could be used to prove this inequality, i.e. the inference below should be held.

$$
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \leq 2^{c(n-1)} + 2^{c(n-2)} \Rightarrow F_n \leq 2^{cn}
$$

It is equivalent to calculate the solution to $2^{c(n-1)} + 2^{c(n-2)} \leq 2^{cn}$.

The inference of the case $F_n \geq 2^{cn}$ is similar, so finally we just need to solve $2^{c(n-1)} + 2^{c(n-2)} = 2^{cn}$.

Let $x = 2^c$,

$$
x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x=\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \Rightarrow c = \log_{2}(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}) \approx 0.6942419136306174
$$
