[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) is a guide written by [Ozan Onay](https://twitter.com/oznova_) and [Myles Byrne](https://twitter.com/quackingduck), and it's for a self-taught engineer to learn computer science. The philosophy of this guide could be summarised in that: For each subject, you just need the best book or video.

In the next few weeks (or months? years?), I will follow this guide, read/watch books/videos advised by it, and remain some reviews of them in this post.
